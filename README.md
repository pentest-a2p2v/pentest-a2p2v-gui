# Automated Attack Path Planning and Validation (GUI)

This is a web interface to [pentest-a2p2v-core](https://github.com//pentest-a2p2v/pentest-a2p2v-core) command line interface.

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.5
- Libraries
    - Flask == 2.0.1

## Usage

1. Clone [pentest-a2p2v-core](https://github.com//pentest-a2p2v/pentest-a2p2v-core) somewhere in your file system (recommended: clone pentest-a2p2v-core and pentest-a2p2v-gui into separate directories in the same directory level)
2. Install dependencies (both for CLI and GUI).
3. Edit [config/default.json](./config/default.json).
4. Run `python3 a2p2v_gui_server.py`.
5. Open http://localhost:3000.

## Functionality

- Run Attack Path Planner
    - This will invoke attack path planner CLI (command line interface), and visualize the generated attack paths.
    - Input: networkGraph.xml, scanResult.{nessus,nmap,common}
- Visualize Generated Attack Paths
    - This will visualize already generated attack_trees_*.json together with networkGraph.xml.
    - Input: networkGraph.xml, attack_trees.json
    - This is processed solely on client side (no server request will be made).

## Configuration

Configuration file is in JSON format.

- `server.host` (string): host name or IP address on which the web server runs
    - WARNING: If you use this in an untrusted environment, set this to 127.0.0.1 to restrict unauthorized external access.
- `server.port` (integer): port number on which the web server listens
- `file.upload` (string): temporary directory where the uploaded files are stored
- `file.tool_output` (string): directory where the CLI stores the resulting attack paths (JSON).
    - WARNING: the entire content of this directory is deleted when the program runs. Be careful when you set this!
- `file.download` (string): temporary directory where the `attack_path.json` files are temporarily stored for download
- `tool.program_dir` (string): path to pentest-a2p2v-core CLI directory (the cli will run in the specified directory)
- `tool.program_name` (string): executable path to the command line interface
